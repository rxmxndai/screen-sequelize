# Running the User CRUD App

This guide explains how to set up and run this User CRUD app, which allows you to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on user records.

## Tech Stack and Pre-requisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) installed and running on your local machine

## Database Configuration and Setup

1. Open the `db-config.js` file in your project to configure the database connection settings:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     HOST: "localhost",
     USER: "root",
     PASSWORD: "root",
     DATABASE: "user_record_db",
     DIALECT: "mysql"
   }

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS user_record_db;

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install all dependencies with: ```npm i```
3. Start with: ```npm start```
4. Contact: [Here](k.romann413@gmail.com) for errors.

# Summary

## Architectural Design of the system

1. **MVC Design Pattern**
The express app is built on the MVC pattern. The model representation of the user object looks like:
```json
{
    "id": "Number",
    "username": "String",
    "email": "String",
    "contacts": "String",
}
```

2. **Routing Layer**

The complete routes and endpoints are explained in the `API ENDPOINTS SECTION` above.
It consists of 2 different middlewares to handle the input validation making use of `express-validator` library. The first middleware checks the validity of the input data and sends errors to the next middleware if any. The second middleware is a function that sends a concise errors data as response.

3. **Controller Layer**

The controller layer has 5 different functions to address the CRUD of users from the database as explained above in `API ENDPOINTS SECTION`.

- The controller function is wrapped with a **global try catch** function that resolves the promises if no errors are found and sends the error to next function if any.

- The app has a customError class that extends Error class and expects 
  ``` Error Message, Error status code and Error data  ``` as parameters.

- The app also has a global error handler that catches any error thrown through out the system and sends response accordingly.

4. **Database Integration**

The system uses MySQL database with the configuration of the following:

```javascript
   module.exports = {
     HOST: "localhost",
     USER: "root",
     PASSWORD: "root",
     DATABASE: "user_record_db",
     DIALECT: "mysql"
   }
```
And, sequelize as an ORM for querying the DB.
